## Building a Linear Regression Model to Predict the Price of Used Cars.

Hello people! I'm Goriola. 
This is a personal project in which I build a linear regression model to predict the price of used cars.
The raw data is a csv file containing information about a few thousands of used cars already sold. 
Some of these info include brand, engine volume, year of manufacture, mileage, etc. and the price at which each of these cars were sold.

This is what we want to achieve: Given some information/features of a used car, predict how much the car would cost.
I hope you enjoy my analytic style and the approach I have taken.

Cheers!
